/**
 * Key detector implementation for the main keyboard with proximity detection capability.
 *
 * <p>This detector identifies the key pressed based on touch coordinates and detects nearby keys
 * within a configurable proximity threshold. It can detect up to 12 nearby keys and ranks them
 * by distance from the touch point.
 *
 * <p>The proximity detection is useful for correcting common touch inaccuracies on touchscreen
 * keyboards, allowing the IME to suggest alternative keys when the user may have slightly missed
 * their intended target. Keys are ranked by their squared distance from the touch point, with
 * the closest key returned as the primary result and others available as alternatives.
 *
 * <p>Proximity detection workflow:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Obtains the set of nearest keys to the touch point from the keyboard layout</li>
 *   <li>Checks each nearby key to determine if it's directly touched or within proximity threshold</li>
 *   <li>Calculates squared distance for performance optimization</li>
 *   <li>Maintains a distance-ranked array of nearby key codes for autocorrection engine</li>
 *   <li>Returns the primary key index and populates alternative nearby codes if requested</li>
 * </ul>

     * <ul>
     *   <li>Identifies the key directly under the touch point (if any)</li>
     *   <li>Scans all nearby keys within the proximity threshold distance</li>
     *   <li>Ranks nearby keys by squared distance from the touch point</li>
     *   <li>Stores proximity-ranked key codes in the allKeys array for autocorrection</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The detection uses squared distance calculations for performance and compares against
     * {@code mProximityThresholdSquare}. Only keys with character codes > 32 (printable characters)
     * are considered for proximity detection. The method handles multiple keys at the same distance
     * by inserting all their codes in order.
     *
     * @param x The x-coordinate of the touch point
     * @param y The y-coordinate of the touch point
     * @param allKeys An array to store the codes of nearby keys ranked by distance, or null if
     *                nearby codes are not needed. The array is populated in order of increasing
     *                distance from the touch point.
     * @return The index of the primary key (the key directly under the touch point, or the closest
     *         key within proximity threshold if no key is directly touched). Returns
     *         {@code LatinKeyboardBaseView.NOT_A_KEY} if no valid key is detected.
