## 📜 The Story

Hacker's Keyboard was originally developed in 2011, based on the Gingerbread-era AOSP keyboard. It became the gold standard for power users, developers, and sysadmins due to its full 5-row layout, working Tab/Ctrl/Esc keys, and essential arrow keys for SSH and terminal usage.

This project carries that legacy forward, replacing decade-old assets and rendering logic with a data-driven architecture and a professional design language inspired by modern IDEs.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Tokyo Night Design System
Integrated 4 high-contrast variants based on the popular Neovim color scheme:
- **Storm** (Default): A balanced, deep blue-grey for all-day focus.
- **Night**: Darker, more intense tones—perfect for OLED screens.
- **Moon**: A slightly softer midnight palette for reduced eye strain.
- **Day**: A crisp, high-legibility light theme for bright environments.

### ⌨️ Professional Typography
- **Google Sans Code**: Designer monospace typography integrated across all keys and popups for superior legibility.
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: High-opacity labels for primary functions with subtle "Hint" characters to reduce visual noise.

### 🚀 Fluid Interactions
- **Seamless Popups**: Our custom `SeamlessPopupDrawable` engine renders keys and popups as a single, continuous shape, eliminating the "floating box" feel of legacy keyboards.
- **Spring Physics**: Responsive animations provide tactile, snappy feedback.
- **Zero Latency**: Optimized for power users with 0ms popup delays and dynamic long-press triggers.
