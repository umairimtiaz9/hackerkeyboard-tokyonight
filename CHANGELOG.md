## [Visual Modernization & Cleanup] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **Modern Vector Icons**: Implemented a professional, "AnySoft" inspired icon set for key functional elements.
    - **Shift**: Clean outline-style arrow.
    - **Shift Locked**: Matching outline arrow with a detached "locked" bar.
    - **Backspace**: Modern "tag" shape with a centered 'X'.
    - **Enter**: Minimalist L-shaped return arrow.
    - **Settings**: Solid, modern gear icon.
    - **Search**: Refined magnifying glass vector.
    - **Mic**: Updated microphone silhouette.
    - **Tab**: Modern alignment icon.
- **Vector Feedback System**: Created/Updated `sym_keyboard_feedback_*.xml` resources for all key interactions, wrapping vector drawables in `<layer-list>` to ensure proper scaling and tinting support, replacing the legacy bitmap-based feedback system.

### Changed
- **Icon Styling**:
    - **Stroke Engine**: Switched vector paths to use white strokes (`@android:color/white`) to allow for reliable runtime tinting via `?attr/kbdColorText` and `?attr/kbdColorAccent`.
    - **Accent Integration**: Applied the theme's accent color (Purple/Magenta) to Shift, Shift Locked, and Delete keys for better visual hierarchy.
    - **Geometry Alignment**: Synchronized the dimensions and positioning of Shift and Shift Locked icons to ensure no visual jumping occurs when toggling states.
- **Resource Cleanup**:
    - **Bitmap Purge**: Deleted dozens of legacy `.png` assets for old keyboard themes and feedback icons, significantly reducing the app's resource footprint.
    - **Layout Consolidation**: Removed unused legacy layouts (`bubble_text.xml`, `voice_punctuation_hint.xml`, `voice_swipe_hint.xml`).

### Fixed
- **Build System Restoration**: Recreated `null_layout.xml` (as a `<merge />` tag) to resolve compilation errors where the build system expected this resource for specific device configurations.
- **Missing Resource Links**: Resolved multiple "cannot find symbol" errors in `LatinKeyboard.java` by ensuring all referenced feedback drawables were correctly implemented as XML vectors.

## [Tokyo Night Edition] - 2025-12-30

### Added
- **True Seamless Popups**: Implemented `SeamlessPopupDrawable`, a custom vector drawer that renders the key and popup as a single continuous shape, replacing the previous "patch" overlay solution for pixel-perfect connectivity.
- **Adaptive Connection Logic**: Implemented intelligent path generation that handles misalignment and tight spaces using adaptive Bezier curves and snap-to-grid logic (`SeamlessPopupDrawable.java`).
- **Precision Visuals**:
    - **Snap Logic**: Added sub-pixel snapping to ensure vertical strokes are perfectly straight when keys are aligned.
    - **Adaptive Fillets**: Dynamic corner radius calculation to prevent "too round" connections, ensuring a crisp "square-round" aesthetic matching the keycaps.
    - **Modifier Integration**: Updated `LatinKeyboardBaseView` to dynamically resolve `kbdColorMod` or `kbdColorAlpha` for seamless popups, ensuring proper blending for Shift/Ctrl/Alt keys.
- **CI/CD Infrastructure**:
    - **GitHub Actions Pipeline**: Implemented automated builds via `.github/workflows/android.yml` that generate unsigned APK artifacts on every push to `master`.
    - **Termux Environment Sanitization**: Added dynamic `sed` logic to the workflow to bypass Termux-specific `aapt2` and `buildToolsVersion` overrides, ensuring cloud builds are portable.
    - **Automated Release Triggers**: Configured tag-based triggers for automated GitHub Releases with generated release notes.
- **Seamless Geometry**: Updated `popup_container_tokyonight.xml` with full 8dp rounded corners and restored strokes for a polished "Pill" container that merges into the keyboard tray.

### Changed
- **Visual Refinement**: Adjusted `SeamlessPopupDrawable` stroke rendering (inset by half stroke width) to prevent clipping and ensure consistent stroke weight.
- **Curve Perfection**: Replaced approximate Bezier curves (`quadTo`) with perfect circular arcs (`arcTo`) in `SeamlessPopupDrawable` for mathematically correct rounded corners.
- **Unified Font Sizing**: Harmonized text sizes between character previews and key labels (standardized at 24sp) for a more consistent typographic weight.
- **Breathe Design Refinement**: Optimized `btn_key_tokyonight.xml` insets to guarantee a strict 4dp visual gutter across all key types.
- **Popup Animation Polish**: Fine-tuned `popup_enter_modern.xml` with better scaling and alpha transitions for a more fluid "portal" appearance.

### Fixed
- **Modifier Stroke Ghosting**: Resolved a persistent visual bug where a green border stroke appeared on sticky modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt). Standardized `LatinKey` logic to ensure all functional keys correctly inherit non-stroke styles from the Tokyo Night design system.
- **The Floating Gap**: Resolved the visual disconnect between popups and keys by increasing vertical overlap and using the patch system to hide the separator line.
- **Horizontal Drifting**: Corrected the horizontal alignment logic in `LatinKeyboardBaseView.java` to ensure mini-keyboards are perfectly centered or edge-aligned with their parent keys.
- **Sub-pixel Aliasing**: Increased the connection patch height to 6dp to safely mask the 2dp border stroke and prevent "line ghosting" artifacts.
- **Double Corner Glitch**: Fixed an issue where long popups extending to the left would render disjointed connection curves by implementing dynamic radius scaling for tight spaces.
- **Diagonal Start Cut**: Resolved a visual artifact where the path starting point created a diagonal line at the bottom-left corner of the key connection.

## [Tokyo Night Edition] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **Modernization Phase II Implementation**:
    - **Visual Breathe Design**: Increased key gutters to `4dp` (using `2dp` insets) and corner radii to `8dp`, transforming the dense 5-row layout into a clean, premium "tile" grid.
    - **Tonal Elevation**: Deepened the contrast by darkening the tray backgrounds (`kbdColorBase`) across Storm, Night, and Moon variants.
    - **Pill Geometry**: Compressed popup dimensions to a compact `60dp` Pill shape for a professional, modern overlay aesthetic.
    - **Spring Physics**: Implemented bouncy `overshoot` interpolators for popup animations, providing tactile and responsive feedback.
    - **Portal Transition**: Added dynamic key dimming logic where the underlying key on the keyboard tray fades when its popup is active, creating a visual "portal" effect.
    - **Unified Mini-Keyboard Box**: Created a dedicated `popup_container_tokyonight.xml` for long-press variations, eliminating the "notched" border bug and creating a cohesive unified tray.
    - **Designer Typography**: Integrated **Google Sans Code** monospace font across the entire keyboard, including key labels, suggestions strip, and spacebar language markers.
    - **Dynamic Font Loading**: Implemented a centralized font management system in `LatinKeyboardBaseView` that loads custom assets with automatic fallback to system monospace.
    - **Data-Oriented Architecture**: Decoupled UI components from hardcoded color values. Introduced a semantic attribute system (`attrs.xml`) that maps roles (Base, Alpha, Mod, Highlight, Accent, Popup) to theme-specific colors.
    - **Unified Component System**: Implemented `btn_key_tokyonight.xml` (Universal Key Drawable), `preview_tokyonight_dynamic.xml` (Universal Preview), and `popup_tokyonight_dynamic.xml` (Universal Shape).
    - **Dynamic Theme Wrapping**: Modified `KeyboardSwitcher.java` to use `ContextThemeWrapper`, enabling the keyboard to swap its entire color palette at runtime without layout duplication.
    - **Surgical Vector Tinting**: Transitioned all keyboard symbols (`sym_keyboard_*.xml`) to use `?attr/kbdColorText` for perfect theme adherence.
    - **Technical Iconography**: Replaced text-based "Ctrl" and "Alt" labels with minimalist, modern vector icons.
    - **Mechanical Glow**: Implemented a dynamic **Tokyo Night Orange Glow** (`#FF9E64`) for active technical modifiers (Ctrl, Alt, Shift), simulating a backlit mechanical keycap feel.

### Fixed
- **Indicator Cleanup**: Removed the legacy orange bottom line indicator from `btn_key_tokyonight.xml` in favor of the cleaner, more professional Icon Glow system.
- **The Boxy Corner Bug**: Successfully eliminated the persistent dark rectangular artifact behind rounded popups by transitioning to a `layer-list` with explicit transparent base layers and purging theme-inherited backgrounds.
- **Optical Centering**: Fine-tuned vertical character alignment within the Pill geometry by adjusting asymmetric padding to compensate for font baseline descenders.
- **Abnormal Popup Behavior**: Corrected the `.` key popup by prioritizing character labels over hint icons in the preview window.
- **Latency Neutralization**: Set artificial popup delays to `0ms` for instantaneous user feedback.
- **Missing Dependency**: Resolved a compilation error by adding the `android.text.TextUtils` import to `LatinKeyboardBaseView.java`.

### Changed
- **Monolithic Geometry**: Refined Storm and Moon palettes to use consistent "Surface Tones," creating a unified visual slab effect.
- **Unified Selectors**: Replaced 14+ legacy `input_*.xml` layouts with 4 unified, attribute-driven layout files.
- **Typographic Scaling**: Slightly reduced global font sizes to create internal whitespace within keys, preventing a cramped appearance in high-density layouts.

## [Tokyo Night Edition] - 2025-12-25

### Added
- **Official Color Source**: Integrated `tokyonight.nvim` repository as the single source of truth for palettes.
- **Surgical Highlights**: Implemented targeted coloring for arrow keys (Purple/Magenta) without flooding the background of other modifiers.
- **Modern Fluid Popups**: Implemented a new `popup_enter_modern.xml` animation with scale, slide, and fade effects.
- **Tokyo Night Design System**: Full implementation of Storm, Night, Day, and Moon palettes.
- **Neon Aesthetic**: Added Tokyo Night green accents to Storm theme popups and previews.
- **Monospace Typography**: Forced `Typeface.MONOSPACE` and `Typeface.BOLD` for all key labels.
### Changed
- **Popup Physics**: Adjusted `key_preview_offset` to a negative value (-8dp) so popups extend upwards from the key top.
- **Vertical Tab Aesthetic**: Set popup height to 80dp for a more elegant "floating tab" appearance.
- **Pixel-Perfect Geometry**: Set all key gaps to `0dp` and used `1dp` insets to create a consistent `2dp` gutter.
- **Tonal Elevation**: Refined all palettes so Alphas, Modifiers, and Backgrounds use cohesive surface tones.
- **Refined Icons**: Updated the Shift Lock icon and other symbols to match the modern aesthetic.
- **Day Theme Fixes**: Corrected color alignment for the Day theme to ensure high contrast and proper "light mode" feel.

### Fixed
- **Purple Flood Fix**: Reverted `tn_storm_mod` to a professional dark tone, isolating the purple accent specifically to symbols.
- **Popup Geometry**: Fixed the black/boxy popup quirkiness with rounded `12dp` corners and vibrant strokes.
- **Selector Logic**: Corrected `btn_key_*.xml` selectors to point to their respective theme assets (Day, Moon, Night) instead of defaulting to Storm.
- **Variant Swap**: Fixed a bug where Storm and Moon backgrounds were swapped.

### Removed
- **Legacy Assets**: Purged all old Gingerbread, ICS, and Stone theme files and bitmap (`.9.png`) assets.
