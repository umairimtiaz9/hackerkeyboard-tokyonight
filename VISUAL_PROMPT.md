### The Prompt (Optimized for LCD Screens)

> **"A high-fidelity UI/UX mobile keyboard design titled 'Tokyo Night: IDE Edition'. The layout is a dense, professional 5-row PC-style keyboard. The aesthetic is 'Modern Cyberpunk Minimalism' using a high-contrast Tokyo Night color palette optimized for high-brightness LCD displays.**
>
> **Key Architectural Details:**
> *   **Layout & Tiling:** 5 rows of perfectly uniform, soft-rectangular keys with a 6dp corner radius. The keys are arranged in a 'tiled' mosaic style with a precise 2dp dark gutter between every key, creating a seamless 'Inset Gutter' look.
> *   **Color Syntax Highlighting:** 
>     *   **Background:** Deep, rich Midnight Indigo (`#1a1b26`).
>     *   **Alphanumeric Keys:** Dark Slate Blue (`#24283b`) with crisp Light Blue-Grey text (`#c0caf5`) in a bold, professional Monospace font.
>     *   **Modifier Keys (Shift, Ctrl, Enter):** Slightly darker charcoal (`#1f2335`).
>     *   **Arrow Key Cluster:** Vibrant Tokyo Night Purple (`#bb9af7`) with a subtle inner glow.
> *   **The 'Hero' Popup:** A finger is touching the 'W' key. Above it, a floating 'Vertical Tab' popup appears. The popup has a 12dp corner radius and a brilliant, glowing Neon Green (`#9ece6a`) 2dp stroke border. Inside the popup, a massive, centered, bold Monospace 'W' glows in pure white.
> *   **Lighting & Mood:** The entire keyboard has a 'Mechanical Keyboard RGB' vibe. Because it is an LCD screen, the colors are saturated and vibrant with a soft, uniform backlight glow. High-contrast, clean lines, macro-photography style, 8k resolution, sophisticated 'Hacker' aesthetic."

### Why this works for LCD:
Since LCDs have a backlight, "True Black" can sometimes look washed out. By using **Deep Indigo (`#1a1b26`)** and **Slate Blue (`#24283b`)**, we ensure the keyboard has "depth" and color even if the screen's contrast isn't as high as an OLED. This keeps the "orgasmic" fluidness intact!
